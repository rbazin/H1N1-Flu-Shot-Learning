# H1N1-Flu-Shot-Learning

Participation to **DrivenData's challenge** [H1N1-Flu-Shot-Learning](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/). Thanks to **Ensemble Learning** based techniques and hyperparameters tunning, we were able to rank in the **top 5%** (over 3500+ participants) for this challenge.

This project was part of the Projet d'Ing√©nieur en Equipe at ENSTA Paris (engineering school).
